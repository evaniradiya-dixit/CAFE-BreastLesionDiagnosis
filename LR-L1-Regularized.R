# This file generates predictions of the 51 BIDMC cases using the 116 MGH cases as the training cases. The model used is L1-regularized logistic regression. The algorithm fits the training samples to a logistic curve by 
# minimizing a loss function based on the active feature values. The approach minimizes the absolute difference of each feature from its predicted value on the curve, reducing overfitting. The optimal Î» is obtained 
# through cross-validation on the training set.

# Input (active features) = ActiveFeatures_Label_HospitalOrder.csv
# Row 1-116 = 116 MGH Cases (DCIS = 80, UDH = 36)
# Row 117-167 = 51 BIDMC Cases (DCIS = 20, UDH = 31)
